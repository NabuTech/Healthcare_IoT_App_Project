    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>During brainstorming and planning, I identified three products that inspired
        and had relevancy to my proposed application. In the <a href="./Landing_Page/index.html">product landing page</a>
        is a lighning presentation on these products in relation to my concept. Using 
        user evaluation to explore these products to refine design and functionality.
        This feedback will be used to measure usability and adapted to measure our products
        usability during development.
