    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I chose to conduct surveys instead of interviews for the user analysis phase 
        of our project for several reasons that are more relevant to our project:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> 
        Surveys allow us to reach a larger audience more efficiently compared to 
        interviews. Given the diverse user base of our target users, surveys enable us to gather 
        input from a broader range of participants.</li>
      <li><strong>Anonymity:</strong> 
        Surveys offer a level of anonymity that interviews may not provide. 
        Users may feel more comfortable expressing their opinions and providing 
        honest feedback when they can do so anonymously, especially on sensitive 
        topics related to healthcare.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> 
        Surveys allow users to respond at their convenience, eliminating the need 
        to co-ordinate schedules for interviews. This flexibility increases the 
        likelihood of receiving responses.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Surveys ensure consistency in the questions 
        asked and the data collected across all participants. This uniformity 
        facilitates easier analysis and comparison of responses, leading to more 
        reliable outcomes and findings.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Regarding the specifics of the survey process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The survey will be distributed via product landing page that will be promoted
        through social media platforms such as linkedIn and twitter to healthcare and technology
        related target users.
      </li>
      <li>The survey includes a mix of multiple-choice questions, rating scales, and open-ended questions to gather both quantitative and qualitative data.</li>
      <li>The initial surveys presented in this report were completed with input from
        friends and family in a semi-interview process. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The outcomes and findings of the survey provided valuable insights into user preferences, needs, and challenges related to remote healthcare monitoring. Analysis of the survey data revealed common patterns, preferences, and areas for improvement, which informed the subsequent stages of our project development.</p>
