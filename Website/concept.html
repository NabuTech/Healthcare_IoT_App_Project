    <h2>Introduction (Conceptual Model)</h2>
    <p>Our proposed development centers around addressing the increasing demand for remote healthcare monitoring through an innovative application. The conceptual model encompasses a user-centric approach, emphasizing accessibility and interaction design in healthcare. At its core, our application seeks to leverage emerging technologies to empower users, particularly those with disabilities, chronic conditions, or in need of remote health monitoring. Utilizing Raspberry Pi technology, the application interfaces with Internet of Things (IoT) devices to collect real-time health data. Moreover, it features a voice-controlled interface for seamless interaction, accessible through various platforms including smart TVs and smartphones.</p>

<!-- User Considerations and User-Centric Design Section -->
<section id="user-consderations" class="py-5">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>User Considerations and User-Centric Design</h2>
    <p>This section highlights the importance of understanding user needs and considerations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Varied user backgrounds, needs, and expectations</li>
      <li>Importance of aligning design with user mental models</li>
      <li>Fostering trust and confidence in the application</li>
      <li>Promoting usability and accessibility for all users</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Definition of Mental Model:</strong> A mental model is a representation of the way users perceive and understand how a system works. It encompasses their beliefs, expectations, and assumptions about how tasks should be performed and how the system should behave.</p>
    <p>User-centric design is at the core of our development approach, ensuring that the needs, preferences, and behaviors of our users are prioritized throughout the design and implementation process. Key aspects of our user-centric design approach include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conducting thorough user research to understand the diverse backgrounds and requirements of our target audience.</li>
      <li>Creating user personas and scenarios to empathize with users and anticipate their interactions with the application.</li>
      <li>Iterative design and testing to gather feedback and refine the user experience based on real user input.</li>
      <li>Adopting a user-centered mindset across all stages of development, from conceptualization to deployment and beyond.</li>
      <li>Ensuring accessibility and inclusivity by designing for users of all abilities and accommodating diverse needs.</li>
      <li>Continuous monitoring and improvement based on user feedback and evolving user needs and expectations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By embracing user-centric design principles, we aim to create a product that not only meets the functional requirements but also delights and empowers our users, fostering long-term engagement and satisfaction.</p>
