## Overview

The Healthcare IoT Application is a cutitng-edge project aimed at improving health monitoring using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. My vision is to create a user-friendly interface based on voice interaction that integrates with wearable devices and other smart devices, to provide real-time health data to users.

## Product Idea

Our product idea in development centers around leveraging the flexibility of a Raspberry Pi server to act as
a central hub for collecting and analyzing health data from various IoT devices. The key feature of our application will be its voice-activated interface, allowing users to access their health metrics effortlessly.

## Development Progress

Currently, the project is in the ideation and planning phase. We are actively researching and exploring the best technologies and methodoliges to bring our vision to life. Stay tuned for updates on our progress!
