## Overview

The Healthcare IoT Application leverages the flexibility of a Raspberry Pi to act as a server, collating data from IoT devices and hosting a user-friendly interface. The key feature of this application is its voice-activated interface, which displays real-time health monitoring data on a TV screen, obtained from IoT devices such as smart wearables like the Apple Watch.
